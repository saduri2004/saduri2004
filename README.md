ðŸ”­ **Current Work:** 

Iâ€™m currently working at @Apple, focusing on modeling behavior and improving language model output, hoping on discovering use-case agnostic optimization frameworks. . Simultaneously, Iâ€™m leading efforts to build external tools incorporating generative AI at Apple Pay. Additionally, I am the founder of Wing Medical, which focuses on using Language Models for deployable automations within clinical settings. For more information, visit wingmedical.health.
 
 ðŸŒ± **Research Interests:** 
  - My research interests lie in Agentic Frameworks and RLHF/RLAIF for language models to steer behavior
  - Optimization frameworks adjacent to DSPy
  
 ðŸ‘¯ **Previous Work:**
 
 I've previously worked at a biotech startup, focusing on language model deployments and combinatorial treatment analysis for complex illnesses.
